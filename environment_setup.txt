To add model weights to your environment:

1. Make a folder in the home directory called unet_weights and save unet_best2.pth and train-all_unet_0.5_0.01_rotation_best-checkpoint.pt there.

2. (Optional) To use our pretrained ResNets, make the following folders and save the following model weights there: 
    a. experiments/resnet_features/beef - best_model_beef.pth (rename to best_model.pth)
    b. experiments/resnet_features/dairy - best_model_dairy.pth (rename to best_model.pth)
    c. experiments/resnet_features/poultry - best_model_poultry.pth (rename to best_model.pth)
